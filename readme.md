## StreamSets Data Collector -- Writing Custom Pipeline Stages

- [Creating a Custom StreamSets Origin](tutorial-origin/readme.md) - Build a simple custom origin that reads a Git repository's commit log and produces the corresponding records.

- [Creating a Custom Multithreaded StreamSets Origin](tutorial-origin/readme.md) - A more advanced tutorial focusing on building an origin that supports parallel execution, so the pipeline can run in multiple threads.

- [Creating a Custom StreamSets Processor](tutorial-processor/readme.md) - Build a simple custom processor that reads metadata tags from image files and writes them to the records as fields.

- [Creating a Custom StreamSets Destination](tutorial-destination/readme.md) - Build a simple custom destination that writes batches of records to a webhook.

We have a DataCollector API Java Docs to share in case of need, please [reach out to us](https://streamsets.com/about-us/contact-us/) if you need them.

## StreamSets Data Collector -- Advanced Features

- [Ingesting Drifting Data into Hive and Impala](tutorial-hivedrift/readme.md) - Build a pipeline that handles schema changes in MySQL, creating and altering Hive tables accordingly.

- [Creating a StreamSets Spark Transformer in Java](tutorial-spark-transformer/readme.md) - Build a simple Java Spark Transformer that computes a credit card's issuing network from its number.

- [Creating a StreamSets Spark Transformer in Scala](tutorial-spark-transformer-scala/readme.md) - Build a simple Scala Spark Transformer that computes a credit card's issuing network from its number.

- [Creating a CRUD Microservice Pipeline](tutorial-crud-microservice/readme.md) - Build a microservice pipeline to implement a RESTful web service that reads from and writes to a database via JDBC.

The Data Collector documentation also includes an [extended tutorial](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/#Tutorial/Overview.html) that walks through basic Data Collector functionality, including creating, previewing and running a pipeline, and creating alerts.

## StreamSets Data Collector -- Kubernetes-based Deployment

- [Kubernetes-based Deployment](tutorial-kubernetes-deployment/README.md) - Example configurations for Kubernetes-based deployments of StreamSets Data Collector.

## StreamSets Control Hub

- [Creating Custom Data Protector Procedure](tutorial-custom-dataprotector-procedure/README.md) - Create, build and deploy your own custom data protector procedure that you can use as protection method to apply to record fields.

## StreamSets Transformer

- [Creating a Custom Processor for StreamSets Transformer](https://github.com/metadaddy/transformer-sample-processor/blob/master/README.md) - Create a simple custom processor, using Java and Scala, that will compute the type of a credit card from its number, and configure Transformer to use it.

- [Creating a Custom Scala Project For StreamSets Transformer](https://github.com/iamontheinet/StreamSets/tree/master/Transformer_Custom_Scala_Project) - This tutorial explains how to create a custom Scala project and import the compiled jar into StreamSets Transformer.

## StreamSets SDK for Python

#### Common
- [Find SDK methods and fields of an object available](sdk-tutorials/find-methods-fields/README.md) - Object examples can be instances of a pipeline or SCH job or a stage under the pipeline.

#### Control Hub 
-  [Getting started with StreamSets SDK for Python](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-getting-started/README.md) - Design and publish a pipeline. Then create, start, and stop a job using [StreamSets SDK for Python](https://docs.streamsets.com/sdk/latest/index.html). 


-  [Jobs related tutorials](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-jobs/README.md)

    - [Sample ways to fetch one or more jobs](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-jobs/ways-to-fetch-jobs/README.md) - Sample ways to fetch one or more jobs.

    - [Start a job and monitor that specific job](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-jobs/start-monitor-a-specific-job/README.md) - Start a job and monitor that specific job using metrics and time series metrics.

    - [Move jobs from dev to prod using data_collector_labels](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-jobs/update-data-collector-labels/README.md) - Move jobs from dev to prod by updating data_collector label.

    - [Generate a report for a specific job](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-jobs/generate-a-report/README.md) - Generate a report for a specific job and then; fetch and download it.

    - [See logs for a data-collector where a job is running](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-jobs/data-collector-logs/README.md) - Get the DataCollector where a job is running and then see its logs.
   
-  [Pipelines related tutorials](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-pipelines/README.md)

    - [Common pipeline methods](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-pipelines/common-pipeline-methods/README.md) - Common operations for [StreamSets Control Hub pipelines](https://streamsets.com/documentation/controlhub/latest/help/datacollector/UserGuide/Pipeline_Design/What_isa_Pipeline.html)
                                                                                                        like update, duplicate , import, export.

    - [Loop over pipelines and stages and make an edit to stages](sdk-tutorials/sch/tutorial-pipelines/edit-pipelines-and-stages/README.md) - When there are many pipelines and stages that need an update, SDK for Python makes it easy to update them with just a few lines of code.
